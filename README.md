# Inventory Management System Application Testing
### Introduction
This will be the frontend implementation used to test the functions of the [Inventory Management API](https://github.com/Ivan-Lazz/StockSyncz.git) in this repository: ``` https://github.com/Ivan-Lazz/StockSyncz.git ```

## Prerequisites
1. **XAMPP** (PHP and MySQL environment)
2. A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Installation Guide
1. ### Clone the repository
   1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
   2. Clone the repository using the following command:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/Ivan-Lazz/test_ims
      ```
   3. Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:
      ```
      cd test_ims
      ```
2. ### Move Folders to XAMPP's htdocs
   1. Locate your XAMPP installation folder. The default path is typically:
      - Windows: ```C:\xampp\htdocs```
   2. Copy the following folder from the cloned repository into the htdocs directory:
      - test_ims

## Troubleshooting
   - If the website or Inventory Management doesnâ€™t load, ensure that:
     - Apache and MySQL are running in XAMPP.
     - The folders are placed correctly in htdocs.

## Admin and User Account
   - To login the admin account, enter the following details:
      ```
       username : admin
       password : admin
      ```
   - To login the user account, enter the following details:
      ```
       username : lala
       password : lala
      ```
